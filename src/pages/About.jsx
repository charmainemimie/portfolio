        Hello and welcome ðŸ˜ƒ !
        <br /><br />
          My name is Charmaine, and I am a Graduate Software Engineer. I am
          passionate about technology and its ability to make a positive impact
          on society. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems
          and Software Engineering from University of Boumerdes ,Algeria and I
          am about to graduate with a Master of Science degree in Software
          Engineering and Information Processing from the same university.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am excited to begin my career in the field. During my studies, I
          gained experience in various programming languages such as Java,
          Python, and JavaScript, and I have worked on projects ranging from
          simple console applications to full-stack web development. I also have
          knowledge in network and computer security. I am a quick learner, an
          analytical thinker, and a problem-solver. I enjoy working
          collaboratively with others to solve complex problems, and I am always
          looking for new challenges to expand my skill set. In my free time, I
          enjoy tinkering with personal programming projects and staying
          up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
